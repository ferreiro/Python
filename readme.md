# Python me please!
Hey! I'm Jorge. Welcome to Python me Plase. In this repo I'm uploading the new projects on Python. I started learning this awesome language in September 2015. So, each project is better than the previous one (I think :P). If you have some improvements and ideas, fell free to send me an email!

####Note: All the code is made using python 2.7.
To run a program, open the cmd or terminal (in mac/linux) and type: python Filename.py
