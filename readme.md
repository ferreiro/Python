# Python me please!
Hey! Jorge here. Welcome to 'Python me Please' a repo where I upload new projects to learn and practise Python. I started with this awesome language in September 2015. So, I think each new project is a bit better than the previous one :P. 

If you have some improvements and ideas, fell free to send me an email! I'd love to learn how to program better on Python.

####Note: All the code is made using python 2.7.
To run a program, open the cmd or terminal (in mac/linux) and type: python Filename.py
